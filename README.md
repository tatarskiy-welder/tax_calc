# Tax calculator
Tax calculator for Russian organisations which use USN.

`Release version will be available on 16.12.2018` 
## Description
Biggest part of russian companies use USN-tax and they have only one employee. They are freelancers, computer masters, plumbers and so on.

I think, that they don't want to calculate taxes by themselves, because Russian laws are quite complicated.

So we made a small program, that will do it for you. Only one input: your income, and you get the list of the all taxes you need to pay.
## Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. Tkinter for Python 3
## Quick start
1. Start gui.py
2. Input your revenue in the form, press the button
3. Pay your taxes
